The first time I am making a webpage is stressful. I had been procrastinating for a while and became totally behind. Now at the last minute, I am working to catch back up by skimming through the learning modules and searching websites for specific tags. With it now being the last possible second, I fully realize just how much learning and practice must be put in to learn the techniques and skills</article>

    <h3>What I've learned</h3>
    <ol><li>Even having just started learning html, there is a vast amount of commands and rules.</li>
        <li>There are ways to validate a file automatically</li>
        <li>A wireframe is a barebones outline for a website.</li>
    </ol>

<br>
    Much of the information I found while scrambling came from:
    <ul>
        <li>The learning modules</li>
        <li><a href = https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp>W3schools.com</a></li>
    </ul>
